# osx_core recipe

Recipe for deploying a basic ox_core server through [txAdmin](https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin).  
This recipe is a work in progress, as are many of the resources packaged with it; parts are __definitely__ broken.

Feel free to report issues but do not expect any support at this stage, this is not production ready by any means.

__**This recipe is provided as a courtesey and is not recommended.**__  
Manually setting up your server with git allows for version control and merging changes.

## Installation
- Open the txAdmin web panel and begin deployment.
- Select "Remote URL Template", and paste the link below into the text field.
